  The Internet Archive took its first snapshot of Lyza.com on March 31, 2001.  I could call the time between 1997 and this 2001 crawl the Dark Ages of Lyza.com, but I don't. Instead, during those years, everything was wonderful and ugly.

The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine took its [first snapshot of Lyza.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010331234559/http://www.lyza.com/) on March 31, 2001. I could call the time between 1997 and this 2001 crawl the _Dark Ages_ of Lyza.com because it’s undocumented, and, consistent with the theme, the site’s background was literally black for the first year or two.

I remember animated, glowing, purple accents — I was still a teenager — and perhaps dalliance with the brand-new `<FRAME>` tag. Then later, definitely, [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML) to make positioned drop-down menus and, if insane memory serves, a car that floated across the viewport (I liked cars, still do).

**What this was: joy**, unhindered by wisdom. Just getting something online. Self-doubt would come later, in spates. But for those years, everything was wonderful and ugly.

## First proof: March 31, 2001

_This is the Wayback Machine’s recollection of my website on March 31, 2001._[^1]

_Themes_: self-absorption, photography and over-reliance on humanist-geometric typefaces, manifested as an ongoing obsession with Futura.

This is one of the few times of my life that I, a chronic _un-fun-haver_, can say that I was _having fun_. (I was also entirely miserable). I won’t speak to the reasoning behind the apparent lowercase letter-spacing being committed here; I cannot recall my own agency in the offense. Let’s go ahead and gloss with forebearing grimaces right over the palette — though I’m sure those are all web-safe colors.

This homespun nonchalance would persist until 2005: no frameworks, no tooling, no CMSes. Just my own naïf’s PHP, a MySQL-backed photo database, an overabundance of Photoshop gimmickry (transparent GIFs!, and, O!, the layer effects and glass filters!) — but again, all of my own hand. Stolid, unglamorous [LAMP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)>) — this was an era when it was not formidable to be a soup-to-nuts webmaster[^2]. Also, I had created blogging software by this point, but I didn’t know that’s what it was supposed to be called.[^3]

If you view source of this capture, you can regale in the inlined CSS, spacer GIFs and table-based layout. I regret nothing.

## And for my next trick…?

_May, 2002, as captured by the Wayback Machine._

A new Lyza.com “is coming soon now”…but is/was it? (And why would anyone care to wait?)

[^1]: I believe the broken images visible here are an artifact of the Wayback Machine's crawling.
[^2]: The term _developer_ didn't arise until the mid-aughts, and, boy, was I thrilled when it did. _Webmaster_ is corny and _engineer_ is inaccurate.
[^3]: Those of tighter scrutiny might allege that the term _weblog_ (cheesy) and its blithering stepchild _blog_ (eye-rolly, an unnecessary contraction) both existed by 2001. They did. But they hadn't really settled, at least not in my circles.
