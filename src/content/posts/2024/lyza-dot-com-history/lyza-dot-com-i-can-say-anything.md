  This did not end the way I expected.

The entire point of this series was that it would allow me to get here and then talk at you about how a _year ago I rebuilt my entire old site in Next.js_ blah blah \[time passed\] um _dev ergonomics, strict typing then subsequent personal crisis about what static-website really means and everyone hates Next.js and React now and start over and finding closure in technical compromise with Eleventy TADA and you see my new website before you_ herk blah boring words.

Forget it. I can write a separate post or, hell, fifty of them explaining all that. You probably don’t care, and that’s just fine.

I realized that, no, actually, the thing is: I could say anything to everyone if I wanted to. **It’s _my_ web site, and _my_ regrettable content.**

Hello, World.

Again.

What comes next?
