excerpt: >
  For several years my pank content machine sat idle, ravenous. Cyclical guilty impulses dogged me: I should do something about my site, I should update my site. Finally, a forcing function.

## 2018

ME: I’ve got to update my site.

ME: ...I’ve really got to do something about my site.

## 2019

ME: I need to put something new on my site.

ME: ...It is getting embarrassing.

## 2020

ME: I gotta update dependencies so I can get my site to build again.

## 2021

ME: I gotta re-architect a bunch of my site that I can update the dependencies to get it to build again.

## 2022

ME: I gotta entirely re-implement most of my web site to make it build again with updated dependencies on a newer version of Node.js.

ME: ...A bunch of those dependencies don’t even _exist_ anymore.

ME: ...I gotta make a new web site.

ME: Aw crap, I’m going to have to start from scratch.

## 2023

MY HOSTING PROVIDER (NETLIFY): We are turning off support for your incredibly ancient version of Node.js in X weeks.

ME: (_muffled noises of despair_)

A WISE LITTLE BIRD (very much NOT ME): Why don’t you just `curl`-crawl your entire site and literally serve it as static HTML pages?

And lo, for the last several months of 2023, Lyza.com was basically the result of a _Save As..._ operation: just HTML and CSS.

...But wait: how is that any different?

No one could even tell. Because I hadn’t _said_ anything in so long.
