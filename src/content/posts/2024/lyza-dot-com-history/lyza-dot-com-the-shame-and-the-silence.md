  **I used to say anything to everyone**. That ended in the spring of 2011 and I flipped inside myself, pausing for a few years and then reducing my entire site to the minimal thing possible when I couldn't avoid it anymore.

**I used to say anything to everyone**.

For a decade and half of another I dropped any thought I had at the feet of the whole world. I didn’t pause, fret over audience. I plowed my fingers into keyboards and published at brave speed. A vignette about walking to work or photos of things [upside](http://archive.lyza.com/2010/02/06/photo-rear-window/index.html) [down](http://archive.lyza.com/2010/02/25/photo-this-is-a-photo-of-a-tree/index.html) in [reflections](http://archive.lyza.com/2010/01/26/photo-laurelhurst-pond-introducing-see-em-big/index.html). Minutiae about my chronic illnesses. Complaints. Oho!, the complaints! The peeves! The snark! I did not care that no one cared what books I read or what I thought about them. I told everyone my [thoughts about books](http://archive.lyza.com/2011/01/09/reading-2010-in-review-2011-goals/index.html) with total lack of self reflection, or spent a week only posting about [the planet Jupiter](http://archive.lyza.com/2010/11/15/jupiter-week-monday-anthropomorphic-moons/). I both hate and admire myself for all that content.

I wrote the last content that I would write for four years in the spring of 2011, a book review of _Undaunted Courage_ by Stephen Ambrose.

![Lyza.com looked exactly like this for years.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfsssdwbu/image/upload/c_fit,w_1200/v1708966618/2011-lyza-dot-com_pz94xm.png)

_Lyza.com on ice: spring 2011 through 2013 This is still what you will see on the landing page if you visit [archive.lyza.com](http://archive.lyza.com)._

Then: silence. Lyza.com, unbreathing, for two-and-a-half years remaining exactly like this. Like the childhood bedroom, preserved, of someone who has disappeared. That’s too morose. But it’s not entirely off the mark: the sometimes-cringeworthy, often of-limited-general-interest, self-indulgent, unfiltered and completely brave content stream ceased that spring and has never resumed.[^1]

This is not at all indicative that the Web[^2] and I parted ways. In fact, we were more best buds than ever. It was during this time that I co-wrote my first book about the web, that I started speaking and writing about the web for various publications and traveling, in relation to the web, and that [Cloud Four](https://www.cloudfour.com) was starting to grow some proverbial legs.

Yet with my own web site, my online persona: a stagnant fug of self-doubt and creeping shame metastazised. I became, in real life, I think, very slowly, a kinder, humbler, but _far_ more boring person, with adult-ish regrets and insights. I think I believe now that I can aim to be only one or the other: creative, careless, self-obsessed _or_ compassionate, thoughtful, wise, a little dull. And that latter path requires a tincture of silence and reservation.

Then again, I took that to an extreme. In early 2014, when the burden of keeping my hand-cranked WordPress plugins and PHP versions maintained became too much hassle for me, and after my WordPress installation was the target of multiple hacking events, I folded like origami and took my site down to only the most minimal bit of printer’s red and monochrome.

![Lyza.com, 2014](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfsssdwbu/image/upload/c_fit,w_1200/v1708968488/pank-bleak_wyh3yc.png)

_Yeah, that is the whole of Lyza.com, 2014. The only marks of humanity here are a nod to the traditional printer’s red and my inability to quit Caslon._

From here, just a glimmer of a hint of a nucleus of a nascent verve — that red is a blue red, a slightly hot red. It is not that many hues away from the pinkest of the pink. So hot of a pink, in fact, that we like to call it _pank_.

[^1]: Yes, as you probably inferred, a major life event impacted this. I hope you won’t be too disappointed that I am not going to share what that was. Even writing publicly that I am _not_ going to write publicly about something is hard for me nowadays. i.e. This. This is hard.
[^2]: I am really trying to wean myself of the antiquated stylistic habit of capitalizing _web_, but in certain cases it still seems to warrant it.
