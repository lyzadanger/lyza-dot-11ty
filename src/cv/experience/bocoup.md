At Bocoup, I continued in my dedication to support and advocate for the open web platform through open-source contribution, open-source-centric consulting projects, and involvement in web technology standards bodies.

During collaboration with Mozilla on a web-testing project, unearthed a decades-old bug across browsers in the anchor elementâ€™s `target` attribute. Built hardware prototypes on LoRA (wide-area, low-power networking) and other embedded systems using open web technologies.
