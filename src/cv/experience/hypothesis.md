At Hypothesis, I participated in the leadership of a world-class team of technologists, building a product that continually pushed the edges of what was possible to do on the web. **Described as the team’s “glue”, I**:

- **synthesized and distilled product needs** out of a complex and sometimes-conflicting landscape, building plans for feature development and design
- **applied broad, multi-disciplinary implementation skills**: coding, technical design, UI/UX, communication, software workflow, and testing — continually delivering exceptional results.
- **brought people together** with technical project management, empathy, mentorship and consensus-driven teamwork. Drove the creation of team engineering values, divining shared values and setting aspirational direction. Refined team processes, such as sprint planning and work cadence.
- **got big things _done_** with an ownership mentality: followed through on big, architectural projects, leading to boosts in performance, reliability and productivity.
- **brought design thinking and humanity to my work**: designed feature UI; created design systems and built associated library of reusable components; was instrumental in achieving WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance; reduced CSS payload by 50%.
- **retained commitment to open web standards**: aided in design and implementation of APIs conformant to W3C Web Annotation specifications; pushed the edges of web platform APIs.
