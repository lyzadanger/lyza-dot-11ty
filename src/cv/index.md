I have over 25 years of experience with the open Web platform, including stewardship, implementation, writing, consulting, speaking and team leadership. I understand how the Web works and my work is united by open-source web technologies and stellar colleagues. Iâ€™m motivated by figuring things out, building things and synthesizing complex information into written or spoken form.
