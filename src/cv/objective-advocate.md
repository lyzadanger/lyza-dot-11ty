title: Objective (Advocate)
---

I have **over 25 years of experience with the open web platform**, including stewardship, implementation, writing, consulting, speaking and team leadership. I understand how the web works and my work is united by open-source web technologies and stellar colleagues. Iâ€™m motivated by figuring things out, building stuff and synthesizing complex information into written or spoken form.
