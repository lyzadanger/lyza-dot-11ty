title: Objective (Dev)
---

A **full-stack web developer with a frontend emphasis**, I have **over 25 years of experience** developing with and advocating for the open web platform. I understand how the web works and my work is united by open-source web technologies and stellar colleagues. Iâ€™m motivated by figuring things out, building stuff and synthesizing complex information into written or spoken form.
