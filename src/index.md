  excerpt: >
    I started writing a series of historical blog posts about the 27-year history of my domain, Lyza.com. I thought it was going to be a chance to trot out technical milestones and document how my website echoed the evolution of the web platform. But it has headed somewhere else entirely.

Hi, I'm Lyza Danger Gardner. I have over 25 years of experience building on the open Web platform. I came from Portland, Ore., where was a co-founder of [Cloud Four](http://www.cloudfour.com/). I’m a generalist with an abiding love for the Web.

I like figuring things out and building web applications and sites. I _especially_ like writing, speaking, and teaching about web technology, bringing people together and helping to be a good steward of the web and its standards.

I’ve written a couple of [books](#books), written a whole lot of [other content](#publications), and spoken at dozens of [conferences](#conferences). [I know how](#what-i-do) web fundamentals work, am reasonably decent at JavaScript/TypeScript, and have spent a lot of time doing front-end and full-stack development.
