  I guess I shipped a few things at the end of the summer, but now it's time to
  find the next biggish thing. Will I be able to emerge from the inspirational
  doldrums?

It's an awkward time of the year. People with little ones are pushing them back toward school buses. The weather is doing something transitional. Vim held strong when entering the season faded into a mild flatness by the end of it.

## A Quick Summer Retrospective

July and August were cerebral for me. I managed to ship [my video about life and springtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz6EUrXizXo), I read a dozen or so books, and, ultimately, coded [this site](http://www.lyza.com) from scratch, but I'm left feeling as if I have little of interest to show to anyone outside of my own head.

## And Now for Something...Completely Different?
